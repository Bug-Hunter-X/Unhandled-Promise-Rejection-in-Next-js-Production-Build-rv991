# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Next.js Production Build

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications where an unhandled promise rejection leads to runtime errors in the production environment. The issue arises when fetching data within a page component without proper error handling. The development environment might not reveal this problem, making it difficult to detect during testing.

## Problem
The `about.js` file directly uses the result of `fetch` in the component's render.  Since `fetch` returns a Promise, the component tries to render the Promise object itself instead of waiting for the Promise to resolve.  If the fetch fails (simulated in the `/api/data` route), the error is unhandled and the production build crashes. The development environment might mask the problem because Next.js's development server includes more robust error handling.

## Solution
The solution involves using `async/await` and a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the fetch request and provide a graceful fallback.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` (or your preferred development command).  The error is not obvious in the development environment.
4. Run `npm run build` and `npm run start` to start the production build.  Navigate to `/about`.  The error should be more apparent.
